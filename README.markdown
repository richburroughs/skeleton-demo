## This demo is deprecated

This demo was made to illustrate how to create new Puppet modules with Gareth
Rushgrove's Puppet module skeleton.

That method is no longer the recommended way to create new Puppet modules. To
create new modules you should use the Puppet Development Kit (PDK):

Puppet provides documentation for the PDK.
