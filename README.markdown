## Demo

This module is for a demo demonstrating some of the features of Gareth
Rushgrove's skeleton for Puppet modules.

There are two branches:

new - This is the module as it was created using "puppet module generate"

master - This contains added code changes for the demo

The demo is of an Apache module that was created with:

puppet module generate richburroughs-apache
